2025-0804 PP updated: moved all main.py in seperate Python files; removed all rust examples

The following examples help understand using RGB Leds using the Linux Kernel driver.

1. [fade_brightness](fade_brightness.py): Demonstrate fading one color in an RGB LED in and out by manipulating the brightness.
2. [fade_intensity](fade_intensity.py): Demonstrate fading one color in an RGB LED in and out by manipulating the intensity.
3. [color_circle](color_circle.py): Demonstrate generating different colors in the color circle.
4. [hue](hue.py): Generate different color hues on the RGB LED.
