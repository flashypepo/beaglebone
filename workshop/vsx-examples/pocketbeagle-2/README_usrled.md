# (USR)LED Blink example

## Goal

Blink LED (USER LED 4 by default) on PocketBeagle 2.

## Overview

Python program `usrled.py` is using Beagle Helper `sysfs` to blink 
a USR-LED on PocketBeagle 2 on the Techlab cape.

Note: `usrled.py` is a modified version of the workshop `blinky.py`.


## Challenges

1. Can you modify the program to use other USER LEDs?
2. Can you modify the program to use an LED connected to one of the on board header pins?
